# Cyclist and Car Detection on Drone Video using Kalman Filter

## 🚵‍♀️ Milestone 1: Torch Docker Container
For testing the docker containers, sample codes are added into main.py files.

```
docker build .
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```
For Jupyter notebooks, after building the container you should see a prompt saying that server is online at http://127.0.0.1:8000/?token=c1b1f0... Use that link to access your notebook. If you want to use your notebook in your local network, replace 127.0.0.1 with your computer's ip address. Then, you should be able to access it in your local network.

## 🚵‍♀️ Milestone 2: Replicate SAM Implementation

The `sam-implementation.ipynb` notebook shows how to use segment satellite imagery using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Use the this Colab link to view the interactive maps
